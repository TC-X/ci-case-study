    - Create a React Recharts <ChartType> component using the provided data. Embed the data directly within the proper component.
    - Ensure proper JSX formatting for React components
    - Ensure the \`data\` property is a valid array of objects, and all keys in the data match the \`dataKey\` values specified in the chart.
    - Use consistent and case-sensitive naming for \`dataKey\` attributes and the keys in the \`data\` array.
    - Validate that \`dataKey\` attributes in <XAxis>, <YAxis>, and <Bar> match the actual keys in the \`data\` array.
    - Return only the component code as a single-line string without any explanations, code blocks, or additional formatting.
